# 🏆 Competitive Programming Practice

This repository contains my solutions and practice problems for improving competitive programming skills.  
It includes problems solved from platforms like Codeforces, AtCoder, LeetCode, and more.

---

## 📂 Structure
The repository includes:
- **Platform-wise Solutions** – Organized by platform (e.g., Codeforces, AtCoder, etc.)
- **Topic-wise Practice** – Sorting, searching, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, graph theory, etc.
- **Templates** – Commonly used code snippets and macros for CP
- **Contests** – Solutions from online contests
